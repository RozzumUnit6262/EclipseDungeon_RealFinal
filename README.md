# Java Dungeon
A small text-based RPG created in JavaFX.

Java Dungeon is a compact, bite-sized text RPG that runs off the JavaFx library and my first real venture into the usage of GUI and object-oriented programming.
It is inspired by simple, floppy-disc text-based adventures from the 90's and admittedly, a lot of Toby Fox works (Undertale/Deltarune).

Author's note: I think I flew a little too close to the sun with what I was trying to accomplish originally, especially with how grand of a scope something like Balatro
would've been, but I'm quite pleased with what I managed to put together at the end; even if the final project got a *little* lost in translation
between base Java and JavaFX. Have a great winter break, Professor!

Author's note 2: Exception handling is not explicitly used, as most things that could break the core project already have built-in 'guards' 
against potential exceptions (eg. the project will not budge until one of it's commands is entered, and will realign itself if a loop or
protocol (ex. player's health goes negative) occurs.
